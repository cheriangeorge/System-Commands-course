## Week 1 Notes 

### wsl: Windows System for Linux
* If you have Windows 11, It is recommended to use `wsl` instead of other options.
* Enable Virtualisation in the BIOS if not enabled.
* User `wsl` command in powershell to install Linux and restart the PC
  - `wsl -l -o` : see available Linux distros
  - `wsl --install -d <DistroNames>` : install your distro
  - `wsl --install` : install latest Ubunto LTS by default
* Run <DistroName> through start menu and Set username and password
* Now you can use `bash` or `wsl` command from anywhere to run your installed Linux distro.
### Linux Virtual Machine 
* #### ISO 
  - image of Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for x86_64 platform)
* #### Hypervisor 
  - (eg: Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation Player)
  - A Hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines
  - It allows running multiple operating systems while sharing hardware resources
### Command Line Environments
* Cloud - replit and cocalc
* Phone - Termux by Fredrick Fornwall

### Terminal Emulators 
* Terminal
* Konsole
* xterm
* guake
### Command Prompt
* `username@hostname:~$ `
  - `~$` is the path
### Know your system
* `uname -a` 
  - prints the name, version and other details about the current machine and the operating system running on it.
* `hostnamectl` 
  - prints system related information such as hostname, OS, Kernal, Architecture etc.
* `msinfo32` 
  - Similar command for Windows.
* `hostname`
  - `-i` : local ip address
  - `-I` : public ip address
* `whoami`
  - display currently logged username
### Getting help for a command
* `man`
  - get help on any command in linux. eg : man ls
  - man sections (1 to 9) eg : man 1 ls
  - 1 - Executable programs or shell commands
  - 2 - System calls provided by Kernel
  - 3 - Library calls
  - 4 - Special files usually found in /dev
  - 5 - File formats and conversions
  - 6 - Games
  - 7 - Misc : macro packages and conventions
  - 8 - System admin commands
  - 9 - Kernel routines
* `tldr`
  - The tldr pages are a community effort to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples.
  - Need to install separately.
    + `npm install -g tldr`
  - `tldr ls` : Use cases of ls command
### Basic Commands and Flags
* `pwd` 
  - Present Working Directory 
* `ls`
  - `-a` : all . displays hidden files 
  - `-l` : use a long listing format
  - `-i` : print index number of each file (inode)
  - `-s` : shows blocks occupied by each file
  - `-1` : each file name on a separate line
  - `-h` : show numeric values in human readable format.
  - all flags in `ls` command can be use in any combinations i.e. `ls -sh` or `ls -liah` etc. to get combined results of the flags.
  - output of `ls -l` : `drwxr-xr-x 5 ckg ckg 12288 Nov 25 10:00 Documents` (`d` is file type ; `rwxr-xr-x` owner,group,others permissions ; `5` no of hard links ; `ckg` is owner ; `ckg` is group ; last modified time stamp ; filename)
  - `ls F*` gives a list of all files starting with F
* `tree`
  - show the content of the current directory as a tree
  - `-a` : show all files or folders including hidden
  - `-d` : list directories themselves, not their content
* `rm` 
  - remove a file 
  - `rm -i` prompts before every removal (it can be set using `alias rm="rm -i"`)
  - works only with write permission
  - use `-d` for removing directories
  - `rm -r mydirectory`  
* `mv`
  - move , rename 
  - `mv file1 ..` (moves file to parent dir)
  - `mv file1 file1a` (renames file1 to file1a)
* `ps` 
  - currently running processes
* `clear`
  - or ctrl+l
* `exit` 
  - or ctrl+d
* `cd`
  - change directory eg cd .. - goes to parent directory
  - `cd` without any arguments will take you to the home directory
  - `cd /` takes you to the root folder
  - `cd -` takes you to previous directory
  - `cd ~` takes you to home directory
* `cp`
  - copy command : cp file1 file2
* `date`
  - date and time
  - `date -R` gives in RFC 5322 standard (used for email communications)
* `cal`
  - calendar of a month
  - eg : `cal aug 1947`
  - `ncal` gives calendar in flipped orientation
* `free`
  - memory statistics
  - use `h` flag to make it human readable
* `groups`
  - groups to which a user belongs
* `file`
  - what type of file
  - `-f` allows you to pass a file in which file names are separated by lines (ls -1 > files.txt; file -f files.txt)
  - `file *`  will give a list of file name and types directly
* `mkdir` 
  - create a directory
  - default permissions (umask)
* `touch`
  - used to change the last modified timestamp of a file
  - also used to create empty files
* `chmod` 
  - `chmod 777 file.txt`
  - `chmod g-w file.txt` (removes write permissions from the group)
  - `chmod o-x file.txt` (removes executable permission from others)
  - `chmod u-r file.txt` (removes read permission from owner)
* `less`
  - allows you to read a file page by page
* `ln`
  - used to create a hard link or a symbolic link (symlink) to an existing file or directory
  - `ln -s /path/to/file_or_directoy /path/to/symlink` : Create symbolic link
  - `ln /path/to/file /path/to/hardlink` : Create hardlink. Although, Linux system themself can create hardlink, we can't create a hardlink for a directory.
* `cat` 
  - stands for concatinate
  - allows you to view the contents of a single file or multiple files (gets concatinated)
### File types 
* output of `ls -l` : `drwxrwxrwx or lr-x--x--x` (l indicates symbolic link and d indicates directory)
* `-` Regular file
* `d` Directory
* `l` Symbolic link
* `c` Character file  (usually found in /dev ; typically the terminal)
* `b` Block file  (usually found in /dev ; typically the hard disk)
* `s` Socket file
* `p` named pipe
### Viewing and Adding to files
* `cat` - to view the contents of a file
* writing to a file : `>` eg : `echo "Hello world" > test.txt`
* appending to a file : `>>` eg : `echo "Helo world" >> test.txt`

### Hard links and Soft links
* inode - An entry in the filesystem table about the location in the storage media
* hard link points to the same inode
* soft link points to a hard link
* hard link must be on the same partition while soft link can point to a file at a totally different geographical location.
* inode is metadata for the file . eg : size ,permissions,blocks etc.
* `ls -i <name>`
* `ln` and `ln -s` is used for creating hard links and soft links 
* inode is unique for every file : if there are multiple entries of inode then it means that they are all hard links
  - if there is a dir level1 with inode = 18874686
  - when you cd into that dir . will also have inode = 18874686
  - if i make a dir level2 inside level1 and then cd into level2 .. will have inode = 18874686 (no of hard links will increase by 1)
  - as number of sub directories increases the number of hardlinks also keeps increasing
* users cannot create hard links for directories (level1 to level2 and level2 to level1 will create a back and forth)
  
### Permissions 
* Files and directories do not inherit the parent directory permissions
* `rwxrwxrwx` (777)
  - 7 rwx
  - 6 rw-
  - 5 r-x
  - 4 r--
  - 3 -wx
  - 2 -w-
  - 1 --x
* rwx rwx rwx : Owner Group Others 
* only owners can change permissions of a file 
* Execute permission is required on a directory to cd into it (Even ls and tocuh to a dir will not work)
* If you want to access a file, all its parent direcories should have **x** permission. This works even without r and w permissions if you know the path.
* r and w permissions along with x is required to ls a directory or touch a file into a directory
* Removing a file works only if it has write permission

### File System of Linux OS
* Filesystem Hirearchy Standard FHS 3.0 (June 03, 2015) (refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)
* `/` is root directory and field separator or delimiter for sub-directories
* `.` references the current directory (. is a special file in every directory)
* `..` references the parent directory (.. is a special file in every directory)
* Path for traversal can be absolute or relative
* `boot` directory is where the kernel is located
* `/usr/bin` contains commands that we will use
* `/bin` - essential command binaries
* `/boot` static files of the bootloader
* `/dev` device files (different character in long format of file listing 'c' instead of 'l' or 'd'. 'c' indicates character file - means you can read from it character by character. if first character is 'b' they are block devices typically hdds - the block devices are made available as files.)
* `/etc` Host specific system configuration (.conf files)
* `/lib` Essential shared libraries and kernel modules (Typically contain files with version number at the end)
* `/media` mount points for removable devices 
* `/mnt` mount points 
* `/opt` add on application software packages
* `/run` Data relevant to running processes
* `/sbin` essential system binaries
* `/srv` data for services
* `/tmp` temporary files (normally flushed when system is rebooted)
* `/usr` secondary hierarchy
  - `/usr/bin` : user commands
  - `/usr/lib` : libraries
  - `/usr/local` : local hierarchy
  - `/usr/sbin` : non vital system binaries
  - `/usr/share` : architecture dependent data 
  - `/usr/include` : header files included by c programs
  - `/usr/src` : source code
* `/var` variable data (`/var/log` contains logs for various services)
  - `/var/cache` : Application cache data
  - `/var/lib` : Variable state informtion
  - `/var/local` : variable data for /usr/local
  - `/var/lock` : lock files
  - `/var/log` : log files and directories 
  - `/var/run` : data relevant to running processes
  - `/var/tmp` : temporary files preserved between reboots


|          |    Shareable  |  Unsharable |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| static   |  `/usr and /opt` | `/etc` and `/boot` |
| variable |    `/var/mail`   |   `/var/run` and `/var/lock` |
